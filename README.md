Shiftkey is a real-time cybersecurity tool that distorts the noise of keyboard presses to counter AI from predicting sensitive data from keystroke noise pattern analysis. Designed for streamers, content creators, and privacy-conscious users, it provides an additional layer of security in environments where microphones are active. 

**To be implemented:**
- Fix OS Compability
- Build UI
  - Implement volume controls
- Implement custom recording feature
  - Find noise algorithm that most closely masks keyboard frequency
- Insert random, unprompted keystroke noises in long typing sessions to increase variability
- Fix latency
